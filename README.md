  warning: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
  discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
  commands sometime before your next pull:

  - git config pull.rebase false # merge (the default strategy)
  - git config pull.rebase true # rebase
  - git config pull.ff only # fast-forward only
